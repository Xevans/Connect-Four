Connect Four (Javascript)

Brief:
P1 denotes player 1, the user
P2 denotes another user or computer player (to be determined in project scoping).

Connect four is a 6 row by 7 column grid based game.
Each player takes turns inserting tokens into a column that land in the next available row.
    - So if a player inserts a token in column 4.
    - The token will land in [n available rows] - [n filled rows]. (i.e. just above the last token inserted in that row).

When a player has at least four adjacent tokens of their color (i.e. in horizontal, diagonal, vertical) the associated player wins.

status variables (global):
    bool win_status, full_status

Global variables:
    int available_slots // immutable
    int token_count
    int cols = 7
    int rows = 6
    


Modules:
    checkWinner()
    checkFull()
    displayGrid()
    displayRules()
    emptyGrid() 
    updateGrid(color, column)

Algorithms ~~~~~~~

checkFull:
    if token_count >= available_slots
        full_status = true

displayGrid:
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++)
        for (let k = 0; k < cols; i++)
            //draw grid

displayRules:
    print rules on screen/browser

emptyGrid:
    iteratively re-initialize each slot to null

updategrid:
    token++

    for 


CheckWinner:




- ~~~ display game rules ~~~

Game Loop Algorithm:
    - assign player 1 as red and player 2 as black
    - display initialized game board (empty connect four grid)

        Loop until broken
        - prompt player to choose a column
        - update grid to reflect player choice
        - disply grid
        - determine if there is a winner
        - if win_status is true -> break
        - check if grid is full
        - if full_status is true -> break
        - player two makes their choice
        - update grid
        - display grid
        - determine if there is a winner
        - if win_status is true -> break
        - check if grid is full
        - if full_status is true -> break

    - if win_status is true
        - display the winner with a message: (Player X wins!)

    - if full_status is true
        - display message: (No more moves!)

    - prompt player to play again.
    - if player choses to quit, end the program
    - if player chooses to continue
        - empty the grid
        - flip win_status
        - flip full_status
        - init token_count to 0
        - loop
